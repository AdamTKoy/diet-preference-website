# Introduction

## What is the food app?

This app is a webpage to help provide suggestions for menu items at restaurants to eat based on user preferences.
The app allows you to filter our food database for the following:
1. Allergies
2. Cuisine type
3. Amount of calories
4. Amount of fats, carbs, and/or protein
5. Specific restaurants
6. Price ranges
7. Proximity to your current location

Or any combination of the above
